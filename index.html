			<h2>History</h2>
			<hr>
			<h3><b>Name</b></h3>
				<p>From its founding in 1919 by progressive New York educators, and for most of its history, the university was known as <b>The New School for Social Research</b>. Between 1997 and 2005 it was known as <b>New School University</b>. The university and each of its colleges were renamed in 2005.</p>
				<p>The New School established the <b>University in Exile</b> and the École libre des hautes études in 1933 as a graduate division to serve as an academic haven for scholars escaping from Nazi Germany among other adversarial regimes in Europe.[7] In 1934, the University in Exile was chartered by New York State and its name was changed to the Graduate Faculty of Political and Social Science. In 2005, it adopted what had initially been the name of the whole institution, the New School for Social Research, while the larger institution was renamed The New School.[8]</p>
			<h3><b>Founding</b></h3>
				<p>The New School for Social Research was founded by a group of 	university professors and intellectuals in 1919 as a modern, progressive, free school where adult students could "seek an unbiased understanding of the existing order, its genesis, growth and present working".[9] Founders included economist and literary scholar Alvin Johnson, historian Charles A. Beard, economists Thorstein Veblen and James Harvey Robinson, and philosophers Horace M. Kallen and John Dewey. Several founders were former professors at Columbia University.</p>
				<p>In October 1917, after Columbia University imposed a loyalty oath to the United States upon the entire faculty and student body, it fired several professors. Charles A. Beard, Professor of Political Science, resigned his professorship at Columbia in protest. His colleague James Harvey Robinson resigned in 1919 to join the faculty at the New School.</p>
				<p>The New School plan was to offer the rigorousness of postgraduate education without degree matriculation or degree prerequisites. It was theoretically open to anyone, as the adult division today called Schools of Public Engagement remains.[10] The first classes at the New School took the form of lectures followed by discussions, for larger groups, or as smaller conferences, for "those equipped for specific research". In the first semester, 100 courses, mostly in economics and politics, were offered by an ad hoc faculty that included Thomas Sewall Adams, Charles A. Beard, Horace M. Kallen, Harold Laski, Wesley Clair Mitchell, Thorstein Veblen, James Harvey Robinson, Graham Wallas, Charles B. Davenport, Elsie Clews Parsons, and Roscoe Pound.[11] John Cage later pioneered the subject of Experimental Composition at the school.[12]</p>
			<h2><b>Motto</b></h2>
				<p>The New School uses "To the Living Spirit" as its motto. In 1937, Thomas Mann remarked that a plaque bearing the inscription "be the Living Spirit" had been torn down by the Nazis from a building at the University of Heidelberg. He suggested that the University in Exile adopt that inscription as its motto, to indicate that the 'living spirit,' mortally threatened in Europe, would have a home in this country. Alvin Johnson adopted that idea, and the motto continues to guide the division in its present-day endeavors[13]</p>

		<div id="organization">
			<h2>Organization</h2>
			<hr>
			<p>The New School is divided into autonomous colleges called "divisions". Each one is led by a dean and has its own scholarships, standards of admission, and acceptance rates.</p>

		</div>

		<div id="academics">
			<h2>Academics</h2>
			<hr>
			<h3>Curriculum</h3>
			<p>Unlike most U.S. universities, The New School has a "student-directed curriculum", which does not require its undergraduates to take general education courses. Instead, students are encouraged to explore before focusing on a major, selecting topics that are of interest to them. Although all "New Schoolers" are required to complete rigorous core training—usually of a literary, conservatory, or artistic nature—students are expected to be the primary designer of their own individualized and eclectic education.</p>
			<p>The New School's curriculum is highly experimental and avant-garde, offering classes such as: "Heterodox Identities", "Games 101", "NYC: Graphic Gotham", "Punk & Noise", "Masculinity in Asia", "Queer Culture", and "Play and Toil in the Digital Sweatshop".[23] The New School also offers a course titled "Social Media: The Power to Speak the Truth". The course explores the transformative history of the Internet and provides a working knowledge of the tools it offers for journalism and public action.</p>
			<p>The university offers 81 degree/diploma programs and majors, with a student-to-faculty ratio of 9:1.[24] This small class size allows The New School to teach most of its classes in the seminar style—especially at Eugene Lang College, which consistently ranks at the top of The Princeton Review's "class discussions encouraged" national listing.[25]</p>
			<h3>Institutes and research centers</h3>
			<p>There are several important institutes and research centers at The New School which are focused on various study fields. Their work is concentrated in the following areas:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>International Affairs and Global Perspectives</li>
				<li>Philosophy and Intellectual Culture</li>
				<li>Humanities Action Lab</li>
				<li>Politics, Poilicy, and Society</li>
				<li>Art, Design, and Theory</li>
				<li>Environment</li>
				<li>Urban and Community Development</li>
				<li>Education (program terminated in Fall 2014)</li>
				<li>Center for New York City Affairs</li>
				<li>Center for Public Scholarship</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>Campus</h2>
			<hr>
			<p>The New School's campus is composed of many buildings, most of which are minutes from Union Square.</p>
			<p>The university's Parsons division also has affiliations with schools that operate independently but embrace Parsons' philosophy and teaching methodology, including Parsons Paris (France), India School of Design and Innovation (Mumbai, India), and La Escuela de Diseño at Altos de Chavón, La Romana, Dominican Republic.</p>

			</div>
			<h3>University Center</h3>
			<p>The New School opened the 16-story University Center ("UC") at 65 5th Avenue in January 2014.[30][31]</p>
			<p>While the 65 Fifth Avenue plans were initially controversial among students and Village residents (spurring in 2009 a major student occupation was held at The New School's previous building on that site), plans for the University Center were adjusted in response to community concerns and have since been well received. In a review of the University Center's final design, The New York Times architecture critic Nicolai Ouroussoff called the building "a celebration of the cosmopolitan city".</p>
			<p>The UC serves as a central hub for all university students. The tower, which was designed by Skidmore, Owings and Merrill's Roger Duffy, is the biggest capital project the university has ever undertaken. The building, added classrooms, new residences, computer labs, event facilities, and a cafeteria to the downtown New York City campus in addition to a library, and lecture hall.[32][33]</p>
